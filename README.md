# Eight Puzzle Solver
Eight Puzzle Solver - give any random variation of eight puzzle board, and this application will solve it. In addition, it can solve it with different algorithms, such as Best First Search, A*1, A*2 (Manhattan Distance), BFS, DFS, and Uniform Cost. 

### Here is example of A* on Easy Puzzle
```
The exact path and its move is:
[1, 3, 4, 8, 6, 2, 7, 0, 5]   U
[1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 2, 7, 6, 5]   R
[1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7, 6, 5]   U
[1, 3, 0, 8, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]   L
[1, 0, 3, 8, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]   D
[1, 2, 3, 8, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5]   
Depth = 6
Cost = 42
it took 7 states
```
### Here is example of A* on Medium Puzzle
```
The exact path and its move is:
[2, 8, 1, 0, 4, 3, 7, 6, 5]   U
[0, 8, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 5]   R
